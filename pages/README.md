# ℹ️ About this folder

This `pages/` directory must **exist** to prevent build issues related to Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) tooling or structure expectations.

However, since this project uses the **Next.js App Router** (`app/` directory), this folder **must remain**.

> ✅ Keep this folder for compatibility with FSD, but don't use it. Your `pages/` directory in `src/`.
